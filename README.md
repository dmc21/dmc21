## 🚀 About Me

I'm a dedicated JavaScript developer with a passion for building scalable, maintainable applications using modern JavaScript frameworks. I love diving deep into **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and I’m always excited to explore how DDD principles can help create more structured, meaningful, and well-architected codebases.

With a strong interest in problem-solving and software architecture, I enjoy designing systems where every component plays a critical role in the overall domain. Whether it's shaping complex business logic or structuring code for clarity and reuse, I believe in crafting software that's not only functional but also understandable and sustainable in the long term.

I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I’m always open to new challenges.
